		<h2>Cathedral and the Bazaar</h2>
		
		<p>I have wondered, for the past...oh I'd say at lest 15 years, where the internet came from.  What is it? How does it work?  Is it realy a series of tubes?</p>  
		
		<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/" target="_blank">"Cathedral and the Bazaar"</a> has been a peek behind the curtain at the Wizard himself.  I am at once less confused and more in awe of the mysterious machine and the underground culture of hackers and pioneers that birthed it. After reading this book, I can honestly say that I know enough to hold a semi-intelligent conversation about the perks and perils of open-source programming.</p>

		<h2>Learning to program</h2>
